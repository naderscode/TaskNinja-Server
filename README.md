# TaskNinja-Server
Taking the previous TaskNinja app to the next level through a client-server model.

Used Node.js and Express on the server-side, VirtualBox and Vagrant were used to set up a basic environment, and to create a separation between the client (the browser running on the host machine) and the server (Node running on the guest machine). 

Used AJAX, JavaScript objects, and JSON to link the client to the server.

MongoDB (a NoSQL database) was used to store the application data independently of our app.
jQuery, JSON, AJAX, Node.js, Express, Mongoose & MongoDB.
